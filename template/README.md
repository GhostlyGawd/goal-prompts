# The golden-path template

This directory is a complete, self-verifying product repository. Brief
`141 · Scaffold the Rails` installs it into the repo the product actually
lives in — copied whole into an empty repo (greenfield), or grafted onto an
existing codebase without overwriting anything — wires the hooks, and proves
the gate bites. That repo is then ready for `142 · Spec the Product`. This
README is the template's spec; it ships with every installation so the rules
travel with the code.

**Design rule (the enforcement hierarchy):** deterministic enforcement
(hooks, CI, exit codes) beats executable artifacts (scripts, templates),
which beat written instructions. A capable-but-fallible agent can rationalize
past prose; it cannot rationalize past a failing exit code. Everything
load-bearing here is therefore a command that exits non-zero.

## Two layers

**The harness layer — operator-owned, agent-read-only:**

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `scripts/check` | the one gate: spec lint → tests → evals. `--prove-red` plants a failing canary and asserts the gate goes red |
| `scripts/spec_lint.py` | deterministic spec linter: required sections, the AC grammar, built-ACs-have-tests, dependencies-have-ADRs |
| `scripts/hook-protect` | Claude Code PreToolUse hook — blocks any edit to the harness layer (exit 2) |
| `scripts/hook-check` | Claude Code PostToolUse hook — runs the gate after every file edit, blocks on red (exit 2) |
| `.claude/settings.json` | wires both hooks |
| `.githooks/pre-commit` | runs the gate before every commit (`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`) |
| `.github/workflows/check.yml` | CI runs the same gate on every push and PR |
| `.github/CODEOWNERS` | routes harness-layer changes to the operator |
| `tests/harness/` | tests of the harness itself: hooks wired, files present, spec lint honest |

**The product layer — the agent builds here:**
`src/` (code), `tests/` (product tests, outside `tests/harness/`), `evals/cases/`
(golden cases), `SPEC.md` (the contract), `DECISIONS.md` (append-only ADRs).

## The contract, mechanically enforced

- `SPEC.md` is the only source of work. Every acceptance criterion is one line
  in a grammar `spec_lint.py` parses:
  `- **AC-1** — <criterion> | check: ` `` `<command>` `` ` | status: next`
  (status: `next`, `built`, or `dropped`). An AC without a runnable check
  cannot be written — that is the product-selection constraint (only build
  what a machine can verify) turned into a parse error.
- Every `status: built` AC must have `ac_<n>` in a test name under `tests/` —
  claiming built without a pinning test is a lint failure, not a style issue.
- Zero dependencies by default. If `requirements.txt` gains a package, the
  lint fails unless `DECISIONS.md` names that package in an ADR.
- The gate runs at four moments, all deterministic: after every file edit
  (PostToolUse), before every commit (pre-commit), on every push (CI), and
  fresh at the ship gate (brief 144). Red blocks; nothing asks the agent's
  opinion.
- Edits to the harness layer are blocked at tool-call time (PreToolUse,
  exit 2). If the gate itself is wrong, the agent's move is to stop and
  report — the fix belongs to the operator.

## Installing (what 141 does)

**Greenfield — the repo is empty:**

```sh
cp -r template/. <repo-path> && cd <repo-path>
git init
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
sh scripts/check              # must be green on the pristine scaffold
sh scripts/check --prove-red  # must report PROVE-RED OK
git add -A && git commit -m "scaffold: harness from goal-prompts template"
```

**Graft — the repo already has code:** copy only the harness layer plus the
two skeletons, never overwriting an existing file: `scripts/`, `.githooks/`,
`.claude/`, `.github/workflows/check.yml`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`,
`tests/harness/` (with `tests/__init__.py`), `SPEC.md`, `DECISIONS.md`.
Then, with the operator's approval at 141's Phase 2 gate (these are
harness-layer lines, so an agent proposes and the operator ratifies):

- wire the repo's existing test/lint/build commands into `scripts/check`
  as one line each, so what already ran now runs inside the gate;
- replace the skeleton's example AC-1 `check:` with one of the repo's own
  test commands (or copy `src/product.py` + `tests/test_smoke.py` too, in a
  Python repo) so the first `scripts/check` run is green;
- then the same proof: `check` green, `--prove-red` OK, one commit.

Skip `src/`, `tests/test_smoke.py`, and `evals/` wherever they would collide
with existing code. Note: `spec_lint.py`'s dependency rule reads
`requirements.txt` only; other manifests are gated by review until the lint
learns them.

**Operator duties the agent cannot do (both modes):** create the GitHub
repo and push; make the `check` workflow a required status check (branch
protection); replace `@OPERATOR` in `.github/CODEOWNERS` with a real handle.

## The loop after scaffold

`142` writes `SPEC.md` (spec-lint-clean before it ends) → `143` implements,
one AC per verified commit, test first → `144` re-runs everything
adversarially and rules ship or hold → `29 · Weekly Vitals` and
`46/47 · Triage & Fixer` operate what shipped.

## Deviating

The stack default is Python 3 stdlib + `unittest` — chosen because zero
dependencies is the cheapest reliability money can't buy, and because the
parent repo proves the stack. A product may deviate (different language,
a framework) only by rewriting the harness layer to keep the same four
enforcement moments and recording the deviation as an ADR in `DECISIONS.md`.
The invariant is the contract above, not the language.
